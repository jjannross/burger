  "description": "A restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. This app utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The MVC design pattern was followed to use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.",
